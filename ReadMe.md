# READ ME

Created By: William Winter

Time to complete: 7 hours

Positive: Ability to fully create apartment from the bare minimum and design however I chose.

Negative: Some parts for lighting and camera were not explained well in the lessons so I had to look at all the configurations in the lesson model just to start the project. Specifically the basic set up for lighting so that the lights work when add them to a scene.
